I developed the Grand Coffee website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing design. The structure was built using semantic HTML elements, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation. Various sections, including home, about, gallery, services, testimonials, contact, and footer, were organized to provide a smooth user experience. 

CSS and Bootstrap were utilized to enhance the layout, providing a consistent and modern aesthetic. The Bootstrap carousel feature was implemented to add dynamic content to the homepage and testimonial sections. The navigation bar was designed for easy access, incorporating smooth scrolling and interactive buttons for improved usability. 

Typography played a crucial role in enhancing the design, with Google Fonts such as Karma and Poppins giving the text an elegant appearance. Additionally, FontAwesome and Ionicons were integrated for icons, adding a polished look to the interface. The image gallery was designed to be interactive, featuring search icons that allow for easy content exploration. 

The contact form was implemented with proper validation for email and phone numbers, ensuring data accuracy and user-friendly input. Google Maps was embedded in the contact section to provide users with location details conveniently. 

Finally, the footer was structured to include quick links, business information, and social media details, ensuring that all essential details were easily accessible. By leveraging modern web development techniques, I created a well-structured, responsive, and engaging website that enhances user interaction and represents the coffee shop effectively.
